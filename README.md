# Tasmanian Ophthalmic Biobank (TOB) Whole Genome Sequencing

This project will involve analysis of 1,000 samples from the
[Tasmanian Ophthalmic Biobank](https://www.menzies.utas.edu.au/research/research-centres/tasmanian-ophthalmic-biobank).

Whole-genome sequencing (**WGS**), genome-wide SNP array genotyping
(**SNPchip**), and single-cell blood RNA sequencing (**scRNA-seq** (~1,000
cells/individual)) have been performed for these samples. Our primary focus will
be the analysis of the WGS and SNPchip data.

The project is a collaboration with the following groups:

- **Menzies Institute for Medical Research, Tasmania**: Professor Alex Hewitt is
  one of five ophthalmic clinicians who established the biobank.
- **Garvan-Weizmann Centre for Cellular Genomics**: A/Prof Joseph Powell's group
  generated the scRNA-seq and SNPchip data as part of the
  [OneK1K](https://www.garvan.org.au/research/garvan-weizmann/research) study.
- **Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics**: will generate the WGS data.

## Sample characteristics

- **total samples**: ~1,000
- **ancestry**: almost entirely European
- **age**: adults
- **phenotype**: controls, no signs of ocular disease

## Development

To setup the environment and pre-commit hooks, run:

```sh
virtualenv venv
