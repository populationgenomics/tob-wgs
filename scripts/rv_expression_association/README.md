## Collection of useful scripts

### Variant counter

[This script](count_variants.py) counts the number of rare variants (freq<5%) present in a Hail Matrix object provided as input.
In addition to filtering for variants that are rare, the following additional filters are applied:
* Variants that pass GATK QC filters
* biallelic SNVs (single nucleotide changes, with only two possible alleles)
* not ref-ref (i.e. variable within the given dataset)

To run:
```
analysis-runner --dataset "tob-wgs" \
    --description "count TOB rare variants" \
    --access-level "standard" \
    --output-dir "v0" \
    count_variants.py --mt-path mt/v7.mt
```

### Variant explorer

[This script](subset_variants.py) takes as input a Hail Matrix object and a list of genes, and outputs a reduced Hail Matrix Table object with only the relevant variants for downstream analyses.
For each gene, the corresponding summary Hail Table Matrix object (generated by [this pipeline](https://github.com/populationgenomics/cellregmap-pipeline/blob/main/batch.py)) is opened, and the variants extracted.
Once all variants (from all genes) have been combined, the original Matrix Table object is subsetted to only those variants, and saved in the analysis bucket for further exploration.
